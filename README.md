## Ethical and Legal Considerations

To ensure ethical and legal compliance, AutoComp will adhere to the following guidelines:

1. **Review Terms and Conditions:** Carefully examine the terms and conditions of each website or competition platform. If there are explicit rules against automated entries or bot usage, AutoComp will refrain from participating.

2. **Respect "No Bots" Policies:** If a website's terms prohibit bot usage, AutoComp will not attempt automation on that platform to avoid disqualification or penalties.

3. **Ethical Automation:** When automation is allowed, AutoComp will operate ethically, avoiding overloading servers, respecting rate limits, and refraining from any malicious activity.

4. **No Captcha Bypass:** AutoComp will not employ methods to bypass CAPTCHA or other security mechanisms, as these actions are often against the terms of service and can lead to legal consequences.

5. **Data Privacy:** If personal information is required for competition entry, AutoComp will handle it securely and in compliance with privacy laws.

6. **Monitoring and Maintenance:** AutoComp will be regularly monitored to ensure it functions correctly. In case of changes to website terms, adjustments will be made promptly.

7. **Respect Website Policies:** While some websites may permit automation, others may not. AutoComp will always respect website policies to maintain a fair competition environment.

AutoComp aims to streamline the competition entry process ethically and efficiently while strictly adhering to the terms and conditions of each platform it interacts with. By following these guidelines, we ensure a responsible approach to automated competition participation.
